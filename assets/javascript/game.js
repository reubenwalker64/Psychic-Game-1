/* The Psycic game
Guess what letter I'm thinking of
Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)
Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)
Guesses left: (# of guesses left. This will update)
Your Guesses so far: (the specific letters that the user typed. Display these until the user either wins or loses.)
Note: When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again (without refreshing the page).
Note: When the player loses, increase the Losses counter and restart the game without a page refresh (just like when the user wins).
